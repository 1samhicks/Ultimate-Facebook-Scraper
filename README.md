## Testimonials üíØ üëç
> The best service I got!
I had the pleasure to have a meeting with Haris to learn how to use a tool that he created called "UFS". He is a great professional and very friendly, with a lot of experience and knowledge to share with others. His ability to teach and explain the requirements to use the tool was very clear. I Highly recommend working with him!!.
UFS is a great software developed by Haris and excellent service that is worth buying

Crist√≥bal V. (Civil Industrial Engineer)

## Purchase ü§ù

In order to purchase the tool, please send me an email at <b>[haris.muneer5@gmail.com](haris.muneer5@gmail.com)</b> and I will help you further. The purchase price is 149$ which includes a <b>TeamViewer meeting</b> through which I will install this tool on your computer and train you on its usage. 

## Important Notes üìë 
Please read these points before [purchasing](https://tinyurl.com/UFS-NEW) the tool:

- Currently the tool scrapes only the sections mentioned above in 'Features' section.
- The default language of Facebook should be set to English for this tool to work properly.
- If there's any specific use case of yours which the tool doesn't support currently then feel free to send me an email at [haris.muneer5@gmail.com](haris.muneer5@gmail.com) and we will discuss it further.
- This tool is not meant for massive scraping (thousands of posts or friends etc). It is possible but the rate of scraping would be slower in that scenario.
- Facebook has taken aggressive measures against scraping so sometimes the account you are using to scrape data might get temporarily blocked (though there are some ways to circumvent this issue which I will share during the TeamViewer installation meeting)
