## News Updates üèÜ
* UFS got included as an official tool in the [BlackArch Linux distribution](https://blackarch.org/social.html)! 
* UFS got listed among the [top 20 hacking tools in 2019](https://www.kitploit.com/2019/12/top-20-most-popular-hacking-tools-in.html)!

## Features üöÄ

A bot which scrapes following five sections about a <b>user's Facebook profile</b> including:

- photos (uploaded and tagged)
- videos (uploaded and tagged)
- friends list and their profile photos (including Followers, Following, Work Friends, College Friends etc)
- about sections (including work and education, places lived, contact info etc)  
- and posts/statuses available on the user's timeline

Data is scraped/downloaded in an organized format (CSV files) for ease of analysis.

## Purchase ü§ù

You can purchase the tool from <b>[here](https://tinyurl.com/UFS-NEW)</b>. <b>This includes a TeamViewer meeting through which I will install the tool on your computer and train you on how to use it.</b> Incase of any query, you can reach me at [haris.muneer5@gmail.com](haris.muneer5@gmail.com)

## Important Notes üìë 
Please read these points before [purchasing](https://tinyurl.com/UFS-NEW) the tool:

- Currently the tool scrapes only the sections mentioned above in 'Features' section.
- The default language of Facebook should be set to English for this tool to work properly.
- If there's any specific use case of yours which the tool doesn't support currently then feel free to send me an email at [haris.muneer5@gmail.com](haris.muneer5@gmail.com) and we will discuss it further.
- This tool is not meant for massive scraping (thousands of posts or friends etc). It is possible but the rate of scraping would be slower in that scenario.
- Facebook has taken aggressive measures against scraping so sometimes the account you are using to scrape data might get temporarily blocked (though there are some ways to circumvent this issue which I will share during the TeamViewer installation meeting)
